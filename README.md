Welcome to UKUI Community.

## Introduction

In this project, **UKUI** or **ukui** means the UKUI desktop environment.

This project aims to provide a list of guidelines that can better maintain and develop most UKUI projects.

This project is used to centrally manage the code specifications, documents and descriptions, development instructions and other files in the UKUI.  

If you find something that needs improvement, it is necessary to sort the changes by category and then create PRs.

## Contributing

UKUI's projects through GitHub do collaborative development, everyone can involves contributing. Your participation will benefits the UKUI desktop environment.

Collaborative specifications mainly describe these specifications:

* [issues report specification]()
* [issues manage specification](./en/issue_manage.md)
* [commits and PRs specification]()

## Documentation

UKUI's projects should focuses on providing friendly documentation for developers, so we have some documented specifications.

This section now in TODO.

## Code Style

This project recommends good practices so that real-world UKUI developers can write code be maintained by other real-world UKUI developers. A style guide that reflects real-world usage gets used, and a style guide that holds to an ideal that has been rejected by the people it is supposed to help risks not getting used at all — no matter how good it is.

The UKUI code style is separated into several sections of related rules, you can checkout content in [code style guide]().

## Licensing

This section now in TODO.
