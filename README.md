Welcome to UKUI Community.

## Introduction

In this project, **UKUI** or **ukui** means the UKUI desktop environment.

This project aims to provide a list of guidelines that can improve the maintainenance and the development of most UKUI projects.

This project is used to centrally manage the code specifications, documents, descriptions, development instructions, and other files in the UKUI.  

If you find something that needs improvement, it is necessary to sort the changes by category and then create PRs.

## Contributing

UKUI's projects through GitHub are developed collaboratively, everyone can involve contributing. Your participation will benefit the UKUI desktop environment.

Collaborative specifications mainly describe these specifications:

* [issues report specification](./zh_CN/issue_report.md)
* [issues manage specification](./en/issue_manage.md)
* [commits and PRs specification](zh_CN/commit_and_prs.md)

## Documentation

UKUI's projects should focus on providing friendly documentation for developers, so we have some documented specifications.

This section now in progress.

## Code Style

This project recommends good practices so that real-world UKUI developers can write code to be maintained by other real-world UKUI developers. A style guide that reflects real-world usage is used, but a style guide that has been rejected by the people who were supposed to help has the possibility of not being used at all — no matter how good it is.

The UKUI code style is separated into several sections of related rules, you can check out the content in [qt_coding_style](./en/qt_coding_style.md).

## Licensing

This section now in progress.
